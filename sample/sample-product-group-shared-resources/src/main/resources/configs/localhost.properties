# Sample service key/value pair landscape properties.  
# This creates a base service path of http://localhost:8080/sample-service-server/rest for the SampleService service when a command line flag of -Dtarget=localhost is used in the mvn call (localhost is used in the default)
# when invoking a test which consumes this automation extension
# Model your service k/v pairs similarly, but name them uniquely to avoid collision in the framework.
